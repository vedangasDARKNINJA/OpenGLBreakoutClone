# Breakout clone from learnopengl.com

I have followed the tutorials from learnopengl.com as the basis for this game with some improved features.

## Features I have implemented in this project:

1.  Improved shader loading (referred to The Cherno's [OpenGL tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2))
2.  Added the batch rendered particles to improve performance and reduce draw calls.
3.  Post Processing effects(currently it supports only inverting of the scene colors) by renderering to a framebuffer (this is included in the learnopengl.com tutorial)

NOTE: This project is just a prototype and is not a finished product.
